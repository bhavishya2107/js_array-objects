1. Create an array named colors that contains five different names of colors as strings.

```js
// your code goes here
var colors = ["orange", "purple", "red", "blue", "green"]
```

2. Access the first color in the array and print it to the console using console.log()

```js
// your code goes here
var firstColor = colors[0];
console.log(firstColor);
```

3.Now do the same with the third color in the list. (Remember that array indexes start at 0, not at 1!)

```js
// your code goes here
var thirdColor = colors[2];
console.log(thirdColor);
```

4.Write one line of code that changes the value of the last color in the list to "ultraviolet" (overwriting the previous value).

```js
// your code goes here
colors.splice(4,1,"yellow")
```

5. Create a new variable called fourthColor and set it equal to the fourth color in the list.

```js
// your code goes here
var fourthColor = colors[3];

```

6.Add another color to the end of the list.

```js
// your code goes here
colors.push("green")
```

7.Add another color to the beginning of the list.

```js
// your code goes here
colors.unshift("black");
```

8. Print the length of the array to the console with console.log()

```js
// your code goes here
console.log(colors.length);
```

9.Remove the last color from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.

```js
// your code goes here
colors.pop(colors[6]);
console.log(colors.length);
```

10.Write a for loop to iterate through every color in the array and print each color's value to the console.

```js
// your code goes here
colors.forEach(function(color){
    console.log(color);
})
```

11.Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every color's value and every color's index in this format: 3, purple or 0, blue etc.

```js
// your code goes here
colors.forEach(function(color){
    console.log(color.indexOf(color), color);
})
```

12.Create a variable named lastColor that will always point to the last element of the colors array, no matter how many colors are in the list. (Hint: make use of the array's length property for this!)

```js
// your code goes here
var lastColor = colors[colors.length + 1]

```
